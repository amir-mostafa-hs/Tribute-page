        Morteza Motahhari (Persian: مرتضی مطهری, also Romanized as "Mortezā
        Motahharī"; 31 January 1919 – 1 May 1979) was an Iranian Twelver Shia
        scholar, philosopher, lecturer. Motahhari is considered to have an
        important influence on the ideologies of the Islamic Republic, among
        others. He was a co-founder of Hosseiniye Ershad and the Combatant
        Clergy Association (Jāme'e-ye Rowhāniyat-e Mobārez). He was a disciple
        of Ruhollah Khomeini during the Shah's reign and formed the Council of
        the Islamic Revolution at Khomeini's request. He was chairman of the
        council at the time of his assassination.
